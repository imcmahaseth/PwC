# Call Center Trends Analysis Dashboard (PwC Certification Project)

This repository contains the data and Power BI dashboard for a Call Center Trends Analysis project, completed as part of a PwC certification. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends within the call center, enabling data-driven decision-making for operational improvements.

| Resolved          | Whether the issue was resolved during the call (*Yes/No*)               |
| Abandoned         | Whether the call was abandoned by the customer before being answered (*Yes/No*) |

## Key Findings

* *Call Resolution:*  A high percentage (90.1%) of calls are successfully resolved, indicating effective problem-solving by agents. However, 9.9% of calls remain unresolved, highlighting an opportunity for improvement in handling complex issues.
* *Average Speed of Answer:* The average speed of answer is 67.22 seconds. While this provides a benchmark, further analysis is needed to determine if this is within acceptable service level agreements (SLAs) and to identify potential bottlenecks causing delays.
* *Call Volume Trends:*  Call volume has remained relatively consistent over the past four months:
    * January: 1772 calls
    * February: 1651 calls
    * March: 1616 calls
    * April: 1612 calls
    This stable volume suggests consistent demand and allows for more accurate forecasting and resource planning.
* *Agent Performance:* Agent performance is tracked across several key metrics:
    * Number of calls answered
    * Number of issues resolved
    * Average satisfaction rating
    * Average speed of answer
    This granular data allows for individual agent evaluation, identification of training needs, and targeted coaching to improve overall performance.
* *Customer Satisfaction:* The average customer satisfaction rating is 3.45 out of 5. While this indicates a generally positive experience, there's room for improvement to reach higher satisfaction levels.  Further analysis of low satisfaction scores is recommended to identify areas for enhancement.

## Recommendations

* *Unresolved Calls:* Investigate the root causes of unresolved calls.  Implement improved training programs, knowledge base enhancements, or escalation procedures to equip agents to handle complex issues effectively.
* *Speed of Answer:* Analyze wait times by call type, time of day, and day of week to identify patterns and bottlenecks. Optimize staffing schedules and call routing to reduce wait times and improve customer experience.
* *Agent Performance:* Use agent performance data to identify top performers and those needing additional support. Implement targeted training and coaching programs to address individual weaknesses and raise overall team performance.  Consider incentive programs to motivate and reward high-performing agents.
* *Customer Satisfaction:* Conduct further analysis of customer feedback, particularly for low satisfaction ratings.  Identify common pain points and implement process improvements or agent training to enhance the customer experience. Consider implementing customer surveys or feedback mechanisms to gather more detailed insights.
* *Call Volume Forecasting:* Leverage historical call volume data to forecast future demand and optimize staffing levels proactively. This will ensure adequate coverage during peak periods and minimize wait times.

## Data Usage

This dataset can be used to:

* Track key performance indicators (KPIs) for the call center.
* Identify trends in call volume, handling time, and customer satisfaction.
* Evaluate agent performance and identify training needs.
* Optimize staffing levels and scheduling.
* Improve customer experience and satisfaction.
* Make data-driven decisions to enhance call center efficiency and effectiveness.
